# randomPassword
Random Password Generator with JavaScript is a simple JavaScript application that automatically generates passwords. This type of application uses a variety of numbers, symbols, letters, etc. to create solid and strong passwords. I used JavaScript's Math.floor and Math.random method to create this.
